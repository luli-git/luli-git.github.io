I am a third year PhD student in the <a href='https://amcs.upenn.edu/'>Applied Math and Computational Science (AMCS)</a> program at University of Pennsylvania, where I'm fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://penncil.med.upenn.edu/about-pi/'> Prof. Yong Chen</a>. Previously, I received a B.A. in Mathematics (Honors) and Computer Science from <a href='https://www.macalester.edu/'>Macalester College</a>, where I was forturnate to work with <a href='https://www.loriziegelmeier.com/'>Prof. Lori Ziegelmeier</a>, <a href='https://www.shilad.com//'>Prof. Shilad Sen</a>, and advised by <a href='https://mathbeveridge.github.io/'>Prof. Andrew Beveridge</a> and <a href='https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/susan-fox-profile/home'>Prof. Susan Fox</a>.

My research focus on machine learning methods with applications in health and medicine, meta-analysis, and causal inference.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
